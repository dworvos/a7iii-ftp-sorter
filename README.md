# a7iii-ftp-sorter
A python program to sort photos uploaded via Sony A7iii's FTP upload function from date of upload to date taken

My wife loves taking photos, this is a simple program that walks the directories that the A7iii creates and extracts the EXIF information to find the date taken and put it into different location.
